# Chinook Digital Media Store: Sales & Customer Insights (1)

## SQL Project Overview

Hi, everyone. Welcome to my SQL Chinook Project!

This project showcases my SQL coding skills to complete some specific results that we may need from the Chinook database.
My goal is to find meaningful insights that lead to data-driven decision/recommendations.

## Dataset: Chinook

The database I'll be using is the chinook_updated.db file that I've already added to this personal_sql_project. It's basically the same Chinook.db with a little of adjustment.
The Chinook is a database representing a digital media store which contains so many tables but we'll focus only in 4 sectors.

* **Customers Analysis:** Contain customers' profiles, contact information.
* **Sales Analysis:** Contains invoices, invoice lines, and payment details.
* **Employees Analysis:** Contains sales support staffs' performances and employees' reporting structure.
* **Inventory Analysis:** Contains tracks, albums, artists, genres, and media types.

## Data Cleansing

This is an additional part where I think it's necessary that I include in my SQL project.
Therewill be both Eng and Thai part. A foundational step in this project involved robust data cleansing and preparation using SQL. This includes:
* Basic handling remove duplicates, missing values, etc.
* Revise address form.
